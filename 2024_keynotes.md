- **Talk Description:** This presentation dives into the contributions of Margaret Masterman, a computational linguist and philosopher. Despite working in a male-dominated field, many of her beliefs and proposals for language processing by computers have now become part of the common concepts in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Translation fields. We will explore her influential work, including the founding of the Cambridge Language Research Unit, and discuss the social and environmental challenges she faced as a woman in computing. Through her story, we highlight the often-overlooked contributions of women in technology.
