# Our History

Hack4Her originated in October 2021, established by Isabella Venancia (Bella) and Mylène. They founded the first Diversity Committee within the BETA student association, STORM, at VU Amsterdam. This initiative was in response to encountering racist and sexist comments among classmates and identifying a lack of clear channels for reporting and seeking assistance.

Bella served as the Co-founder and Chair of the Diversity Committee, with Mylène as the Vice Chair, up until their graduation. Their efforts were directed towards fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect.

The concept for Hack4Her was inspired by their observations at the Amsterdam Algorithm Programming Preliminary (AAPP), where a significant underrepresentation of women was noted. Inquiry into the low participation of women revealed concerns over feeling unwelcome, and underqualified, and the discomfort of being the only female participant.

Supported by BETA faculty member Katja Tuma, the first Hack4Her hackathon took place in June 2022 at VU Amsterdam. The event was women-only and attracted 35 attendees. [Learn more about the event](#).

In 2023, the event was expanded to welcome all genders while maintaining a focus on women in tech. Held at the Booking.com office with Booking.com as the main sponsor, the participation increased to 75, with a total of 100 attendees. This iteration emphasized a broader learning and networking experience. [Learn more about the event](#).

Hack4Her was founded to create a supportive and inclusive tech community. Its evolution reflects a commitment to these principles, with each event building upon the last to advance diversity in technology.

## What are we?

Hack4Her is a pioneering hackathon event focused on empowering and promoting female students in technical fields. It stands out as the only continued women-only student hackathon in the Netherlands, making a significant impact in the tech community by fostering inclusivity, diversity, and innovation.

### Participation Tiers

Hack4Her is structured into two participation tiers to maximize its impact and reach:

1. **Open Tier:** This is open to all students in the Netherlands who are enrolled in a technical program. It provides an inclusive platform for students of all genders to engage in technical challenges, fostering a broader understanding and appreciation of diversity in tech.

2. **Female-Only Tier:** Exclusively for female students, this tier has a limited availability of 60 tickets. 30 of which can get accommodation if living outside of Amsterdam. It offers a unique opportunity for female tech enthusiasts to showcase their skills, learn, and network in a supportive environment. This tier is particularly focused on addressing the gender gap in tech and providing a platform for female voices and talent in the field.

Hack4Her not only aims to highlight the technical prowess of participants but also seeks to build a supportive community where students can grow their networks and gain valuable industry insights.

# <a id="anchor-impact">Impact</a> 
This is the _**first continued women-only student hackathon**_ in the Netherlands, and for the past five years, the only such event in the country. Radboud Women of Computing Science hosted a similar event called The Women Tech Storm in 2018 [11]. Other programming competitions (not female focused) are held at VUA campus as well as several national, european and international working groups organising various events to promote diversity and inclusion in academia (Radboud Women of Computing Science [11], EUGAIN [12], EDI IPN Working Group [13], to name a few). There are, of course, mainstream hackathons and conferences promoting female learnership organised by industries [14] in the Amsterdam area and beyond.

## Added value for the individual participants
Students benefit from joining the event individually from several perspectives. First, it increases their _**visibility**_ on the job market. Second, they gain _**knowledge and experience**_ in solving a technical challenge with value to the real world. In addition, they create a _**network of peers**_ and gain _**contacts in the industry**_ (e.g., internships at sponsor companies). Finally, they could win a prize (museum card voucher, smart watch, e-readers, women-in-tech conference ticket, etc.). While the latter is the least valuable, it is an important motivator for the teams.

## Social impact on the student population
An important change that we implemented in the 2023 edition was opening the general program (workshops, lectures) to students of all gender identities. This resulted in over 100 participants (overall) attending parts of the program. It has worked very well and increased the awareness and appreciation of the event. Thanks to the inclusive general program, we have observed a huge increase (164% compared to 2022) in the number of interested students (161 in total) to participate in the event. Such that we were forced to implement a waiting list of up to 20+ participants, favouring women and participants intending to join the whole program. 59.6% of the interested students identified as men and 36.6% identified as women. We believe that the event has potential for a long-term positive impact on the general student population as we also include diversity and inclusion workshops and lectures. In addition we have received applications by participants studying different programs (though, CS and AI remained in majority), however diversity is key here, so we look forward to the future.
