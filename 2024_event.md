# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 3rd Annual Hack4Her Event June 7-9, 2024! ðŸŒŸ

This year, we're continuing to celebrate the incredible talent of women in tech with a women-centered weekend, an UvA and VU Amsterdam joint event. 

ðŸš€ Join us for an exciting weekend of coding, innovation, learning, networking, and fun at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam! ðŸš€

## Dates & Times:

- **Kickoff:** June 7th, 17:00 - 21:00
- **Full Days:** June 8th, 9:00 - 21:00 & June 9th, 9:00 - 18:00

## What's on Offer:

- **Engaging Hackathon:** Dive into challenges, bring your ideas to life, and compete for exciting prizes. Limited coding experience is fine! We aim to have people expand on their problem-solving, and project-development skills, and learn some coding along the way!
