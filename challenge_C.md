## DuckDB challenge: "SafePath" - Enhancing Women's Safety Through Community-Enabled Mapping in Amsterdam

### Challenge Summary

"SafePath" (feel free to change the name) is an innovative, community-driven app/website designed to enhance personal safety for women in Amsterdam by providing safer, community-vetted walking routes. Using the extensive geographic data from Overture Maps and the powerful on-the-fly data processing capabilities of DuckDB, participants will create an app/website that helps users navigate based on safety ratings and real-time community feedback rather than just distance or travel time.

### Objective

Develop an app that integrates Overture Maps for route data and DuckDB for storing and querying safety data (like public lighting, crime statistics, and community feedback). The app should allow users to select routes based on safety criteria and contribute their own experiences to help others make informed travel decisions.

### Tools and Technologies

- Overture Maps: For accessing and displaying geographic and route data. [Extracting Data Locally | Overture Maps Documentation](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/locally/) [README.md - Overture Maps Data Repo](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/blob/main/README.md#how-to-access-overture-maps-data)

- DuckDB: For managing and querying structured data such as user feedback, crime statistics, and route safety scores. [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/#quickinstall)

- Programming Languages: Python, Basic SQL. 

### Given (All Generated/Simulated):

- Crime Statistics: Integrate area-specific crime data to evaluate route risks. 

- Public Lighting Data: Include data on street lighting to assess night-time travel safety.

- Community Feedback: Implement functionality for users to rate routes and share safety experiences.

### Expected Deliverables

- Functional Prototype: A ‚Äúworking‚Äù version of the app with basic navigation and safety features. This could be a presentation with concepts on each slide for a screen.  Show the use of Overture Maps. There are tons of prototyping tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Proto.io, Marvel App, and Canva but you could also use Google Slides or Powerpoint.

- Data Integration: Show how safety data is incorporated into route selection.

- User Interface: An easy-to-use interface that allows users to choose routes, view route safety ratings, and submit their own feedback.

- Presentation: A ‚Äúdemo‚Äù of the app including explanations of the use of Overture Maps and DuckDB, and how these technologies help achieve the project goals.

### Judging Criteria

- Innovation and Originality: Creativity in how safety features are implemented.

- Impact on Women‚Äôs Safety: Effectiveness of the app in enhancing women's safety.

- Quality of Implementation: Robustness and usability of the software.

- Use of Technology: Effective use of Overture Maps and DuckDB.
