<!-- About Us Brief -->
## About Us
Hack4Her is the only female-focused student hackathon in the Netherlands, creating a space where technology and diversity meet. Our mission is simple: to create a women-centered space in the tech world. We’re dedicated to providing a welcoming atmosphere that fosters learning and innovation for all students. Our goal is to bridge the gender gap in technology by fostering a diverse ecosystem of students, mentors, and leaders.

Hack4Her is not just a hackathon; it's a movement. A weekend at Hack4Her means engaging in an environment rich with challenges and opportunities, where participants can experiment, innovate, and connect with like-minded individuals and mentors in the tech industry. Our platform celebrates diversity, where all students from across the Netherlands can join in the camaraderie, code, and competition.

Join us as we gear up for our 3rd Annual Hack4Her Event, a vibrant coding, learning, and networking weekend. Collaborate with peers, learn from experts, and challenge yourself at our UvA and VU Amsterdam joint event. It’s more than a competition; it’s a place to grow, connect, and be inspired.
