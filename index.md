## About Us
Hack4Her is the only female-focused student hackathon in the Netherlands, creating a space where technology and diversity meet. We are a coalition of staff and students from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Universiteit van Amsterdam. Our mission is simple: to create a women-centered space in the tech world. Weâ€™re dedicated to providing a welcoming atmosphere that fosters learning and innovation for all students. We aim to bridge the gender gap in technology by fostering a diverse ecosystem of students, mentors, and leaders.

Hack4Her is not just a hackathon; itâ€™s a movement. A weekend at Hack4Her means engaging in an environment rich with challenges and opportunities, where participants can experiment, innovate, and connect with like-minded individuals and mentors in the tech industry. Our platform celebrates diversity, where all students from across the Netherlands can join in the camaraderie, code, and competition.
