# Challenge D: The Optiver Challenge

According to a 2024 [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fnpe0000189), men are 91% more likely to invest in the stock market than women, preventing women from realizing life-changing gains from their savings. With this challenge, we want to help you to beat the statistics and show you how you can trade too! In fact, you will be creating your very own trading algorithm in python which you will use to trade on our simulated exchange, Optibook. You will compete with other teams, see how your strategy performs, refine it and try again! If you donâ€™t know anything about trading, donâ€™t worry! Then you are exactly the kind of person we want to see doing our challenge! In our workshop, we explain the basics of finance and trading and of course we are here to help through the weekend!
