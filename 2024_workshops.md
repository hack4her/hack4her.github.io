### Workshop 6: Can LLMs promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech teams? A joint look on the past, present, and future

- **Time:** 16:30 PM - 17:30
  
- **Person:** Dr. Mairieli Wessel

- **Title:** Assistant Professor

- **Academic Title:** Dr. 

- **Affiliation:** Radboud Universiteit
  
- **Biography:** Mairieli Wessel is an assistant professor at Radboud University. Upon receiving her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo (USP), she was awarded the Best Brazilian Ph.D. Thesis on Software Engineering in 2021. Her research interests include software engineering (SE) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Recent projects include the development of tools and strategies to support open-source software communities and the design of automated tools like bots and chatbots. For more information check out her [website](https://mairieli.com ).

- **Workshop Description:** Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven an explosion of interest in their societal impacts. Much of the discussion on how they will impact diversity, equity, and inclusion has been primarily negative, focusing on questions like “How might LLMs be biased, and how would we mitigate those biases?” This is a vital discussion: how AI generally, and LLMs specifically, can entrench biases has been studied. But equally important, and much less discussed, is the more opportunity-focused counterpoint: “What promising applications do LLMs enable that could promote diversity, equity, and inclusion?” This talk will discuss opportunities for LLMs to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in society, especially in teams building tech solutions like software development and hackathon teams.

 


## Sunday


### Workshop 7:  Inclusive AI: Advancing Accessibility

- **Time:** 11:15 AM - 12:15
  
- **Person:** Dr. Çiçek Güven
  
- **Title:** Assistant professor in the Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence department

- **Academic Title:** Dr.
  
- **Affiliation:**  Tilburg University
  
- **Biography:** Çiçek is an assistant professor in the Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence department at Tilburg University. Her research interests, in general, are network analysis and learning on graph-structured data.  She has a mathematical background,  her thesis involved algebraic graph theory and combinatorics.  She also worked in the industry for a period of four years in banking and consultancy environments as a quant and data analyst, working with financial and trade data mainly.  Data science projects with a social aspect motivate her a lot.  This interest is effectuated in multiple research projects she is involved in utilising AI to create a more inclusive and accessible world. Some examples are  the 'Child Growth Monitor' by Zero Hunger Lab;  focusing on malnutrition detection in children,  Ilustre, a project  to support the energy transition efforts in the Caribbean, and the Icon project of Zero Poverty Lab, linking brain networks and poverty.
  
- **Workshop Description:** AI's potential to enhance inclusion becomes evident when it actively identifies and addresses the needs of underprivileged groups, those who are struggling to have access to their basic needs, such as food and education. In light of this, we have been focusing on contributing to the solutions to societal problems such as poverty, malnutrition school dropout. With this talk, I want to give examples of how we center our research around inclusivity, accessibility, and societal problems, both in the problems we focus on and in the methods we use and frameworks we develop.
  

### Workshop 8: Logic Synthesis for AI

- **Time:** 12:45 PM - 14:15
  
- **Person:** Marcel Walter
  
- **Academic Title:** Prof. Dr.
  
- **Job Title:** Visiting Professor and Postdoc
  
- **Affiliation:** University of Bremen and Technical University of Munich
  
- **Biography:** Marcel Walter is a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at the University of Bremen, Germany, where he also received his Ph.D. in 2021 for his work on algorithms for the physical design of emerging post-CMOS nanotechnologies. He also works as a Postdoc at the Chair for Design Automation at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and has been working for the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). He is the initiator and maintainer of the "fiction" framework for the logic synthesis, physical design, verification, and simulation of Field-coupled Nanotechnologies.
  
- **Links:** [Github](https://marcelwa.github.io/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-walter-94b573195/)
  
- **Workshop Description:** Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are the defining technologies of this decade. However, training and running state-of-the-art models require significant computational power, typically provided by large GPU clusters. One promising solution is the development of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom hardware designed to accelerate specific applications. In this workshop, attendees will learn about the logic synthesis and physical design processes used to create ASIC layouts from specifications. They will apply these techniques to generate custom machine-learning accelerators and inference engines ready for tape-out. The workshop includes a hands-on session for practical experience.
