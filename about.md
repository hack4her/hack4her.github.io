# Our History
![Image of past event](assets/images/history.jpg)


Hack4Her originated in October 2021, established by Isabella Venancia (Bella) and Mylène. They founded the first Diversity Committee within the BETA student association, STORM, at VU Amsterdam. This initiative was in response to encountering racist and sexist comments among classmates and identifying a lack of clear channels for reporting and seeking assistance.

Bella served as the Co-founder and Chair of the Diversity Committee, with Mylène as the Vice Chair, up until their graduation. Their efforts were directed towards fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect.

During Mylène's time as the AAPCie committee secretary, she observed a significant underrepresentation of women at the Amsterdam Algorithm Programming Preliminary (AAPP). This led to the concept of Hack4Her, aimed at creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for women in competitive programming.

Supported by BETA faculty member Katja Tuma, the first Hack4Her hackathon took place in June 2022 at VU Amsterdam. The event was women-only and attracted 35 attendees. [Learn more about the event](/events_archive).

In 2023, the event was expanded to welcome all genders while maintaining a focus on women in tech. Held at the Booking.com office with Booking.com as the main sponsor, the participation increased to 75, with a total of 100 attendees. This iteration emphasized a broader learning and networking experience. [Learn more about the event](/events_archive).

Hack4Her was founded to create a supportive and inclusive tech community. Its evolution reflects a commitment to these principles, with each event building upon the last to advance diversity in technology.
