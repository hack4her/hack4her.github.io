# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 3rd Annual Hack4Her Event June 7-9, 2024! ðŸŒŸ

This year, we're continuing to celebrate the incredible talent of women in tech with a women-centered weekend, an UvA and VU Amsterdam joint event. All students (Bachelor's, Master's) in the Netherlands are eligible to register to join.  While all genders are welcome to participate in the event, only individuals who identify as women are eligible to compete in the hackathon portion of the event, but do not worry if you do not want to participate in a hackathon or are not eligible there are still plenty of interesting activities to do! If you are an academic in the Netherlands, who is not a student (PhD candidate, Professor, etc.), and you are interested in joining for all or part of this event, please get in touch with us [here](mailto:hack4her2024@gmail.com).
