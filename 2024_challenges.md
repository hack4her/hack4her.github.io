# Challenge D: The Optiver Challenge

Did you know that [studies](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters) have shown that "companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile"? Let's translate this powerful insight into a profitable investment strategy that also champions companies with outstanding gender diversity. Enter Opti-DivInc-Fund, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that bundles together a basket of companies with strong Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices. In this hackathon challenge, you'll learn how to trade the Opti-DivInc-Fund. By doing so, you'll ensure this unique basket of companies remain accessible and attractive to a wide range of investors. Not only does this promote ethical investing, but it also has the potential to drive meaningful change in corporate culture. Let's get started!
