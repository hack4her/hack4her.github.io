## Challenge Summary

ServiceNow, a Fortune 500 company, is The AI Platform for Business Transformation enabling 80% of the Fortune 500 companies to digitize and unify so that they can find smarter, faster, better ways to make work flow. We are empowering and educating 1 million individuals from marginalized communities in the ServiceNow platform.
