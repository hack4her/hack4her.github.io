### What is an Expert Session?

An expert session is a dedicated time where you can interact with industry professionals and academic experts who are here to assist you with any questions or challenges you might be facing. Whether you need help with a specific project, have career-related inquiries, or are curious about their companies and roles, this is your opportunity to gain valuable insights and guidance.

During these sessions, our experts will be available to:
- Answer questions about their field of expertise
- Provide guidance on technical issues or project challenges
- Share advice on career paths and opportunities in their industries
- Discuss the work culture and values of their respective companies

Think of it as an enhanced TA session, where you can tap into a wealth of knowledge and experience to help you succeed and grow, both personally and professionally.

Feel free to come prepared with your questions and make the most of this unique opportunity to learn from those who have been there and done that.

You are also more than welcome to just sit in the room and do your own work independently.
