# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 3rd Annual Hack4Her Event June 7-9, 2024! ðŸŒŸ

Join us for a weekend focused on creating a women-centric tech space, presented jointly by the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and VU Amsterdam. All students in the Netherlands are welcome to register. We offer participants two distinct tracks: the hackathon track and the non-hackathon track. While all genders are welcome to participate in the event, **only individuals who identify as women are eligible to compete in the hackathon**. If you're an academic professional in the Netherlandsâ€”whether a Ph.D. candidate, professor, or beyondâ€”and you're interested in participating in any aspect of this event, please don't hesitate to reach out to us [here](mailto:hack4her2024@gmail.com).
