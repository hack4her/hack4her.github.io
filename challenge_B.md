## Booking.com Challenge: Solo Women Traveler Network

### Challenge Summary

Booking.com is committed to becoming more women-friendly and ensuring that solo women travelers have safe, enjoyable, and empowering travel experiences. We invite you to participate in the "Solo Women Traveler Network" hackathon, where your task will be to leverage your programming skills to build, analyze, and enhance networks (graphs) related to solo women travelers.


### Objective

Develop a tool, application, or comprehensive presentation that uses graph-based data analysis to provide meaningful insights into various aspects of solo women travelers' experiences. Participants can choose to build new networks (graphs) from the provided data, analyze existing networks, or enhance and add to existing networks. Your solution can focus on any aspect that enhances the travel experience for solo women, such as travel patterns, accommodation preferences, popular destinations, social interactions, or any other relevant factors.


### Tools and Technologies (recommended, not required)

- NetworkX or other graph libraries: For creating and analyzing graphs.

- Visualization tools: Such as D3.js, Gephi, or similar, to visualize the network data.

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, or any language suitable for data analysis and visualization.


### Given (All Generated/Simulated):

- Accommodation Reviews and Ratings: Including safety scores and whether accommodations are women-only.

- Travel Itineraries and Routes: Detailed travel patterns of solo women travelers.

- Safety Ratings of Destinations: Based on historical data of reported incidents.
